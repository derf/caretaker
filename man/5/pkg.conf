=head1 NAME

~/.pkg.conf - L<pkg>(1) configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains configuration variables for L<pkg>(1)

The file consists of multiple lines of the form I<variable>=I<value>.

Normal zsh syntax is allowed, which means everything after '#' will be treated
a comment and that there must be no space between the variable and the content.

With the exception of B<PKG_ROOT>, all variables are optional as they have
reasonable (so I hope) defaults.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<PKG_ROOT>=I<url>

the package root path.
I<url> may either be of the form C<ssh://host/path> or C</path>.

=item B<PKGLIST_PATH>=I<path> ($PKG_PATH/pkglist)

path to pkglist on the package root, to generate the package list.
In the default, $PKG_PATH means the path component of $PKG_ROOT.

=item B<PKG_DIR>=I<path> ($HOME/packages)

path for the local package tree

=item B<CL_OPTIONS>=I<options> (-q)

Options to invoke L<checklinks>(1) with

=item B<SILENT>=I<boolean> (0)

Operate in silent mode if 1

=item B<DEBUG>=I<boolean> (0)

Operate in debug mode if 1

=item B<AUTOUPDATE>=I<boolean> (1)

If 1, automatically execute 'pkg update' before 'pkg push'
and 'pkg remote-update' before 'pkg upgrade'

=item B<GIT_USE_ORIGIN>=I<boolean> (1)

By default, pkg will simply issue a git push/pull, so that git will use the
repository's origin to determine where to push/pull.

If you regularly change your PKG_ROOT, are too lazy to properly configure your
git repos or whatever, set this to 0. Then, pkg will always call git pull/push
with both the remote repo and the branch as arguments.

=item B<function pkg_hook_>I<hook> {I<content>}

Define the global hook I<hook>, its I<content> will be executed
together with pkg's global hooks; the name of the package for which the hook is
being executed will be given as first parameter and is accessible throug B<$1>.
The hook is just a zsh function, so you can use any valid syntax you want,
including newlines.
See zsh(1) for more.

Valid I<hook> names are: post-add, pre-update, post-update, pre-remove.
Note that post-add automatically executes post-update.

Example: function pkg_hook_post-update {clear_line; echo "Hello from package $1!"}
