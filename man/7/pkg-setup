pkg - Package root setup

=head1 PACKAGE ROOT

First, you'll need to create a root directory (from now on PKG_ROOT) on the
server which shall from now on host all your packages.
Then you need to put the pkg git repository into F<PKG_ROOT/pkg> - it's recommended
to do this via git clone --bare.

Copy the pkglist script (include/pkglist) to F<PKG_ROOT/pkglist>.

Now you can add your own packages as git repos in PKG_ROOT.

To use pkg with your packages on a machine, download and execute
the bootstrap script (include/bootstrap).
